the idea for this was too have a system in place that automatically scrap spotify api for my user's account for my playlist, and let it run automatically everyday and always have a cold backup of all my playlists because spotify could go down under for whatever reason and my memory is so bad i would never remember 99% of the artists so feel free to clone the setup and use it. ill write more on what why i chose to do it this way some time.
